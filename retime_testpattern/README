Unix/Linux test patternfile retimming tool


Idea
  Change timing of generated WGL / VEC test pattern.
  Minimal dependencies ([t]csh, [g]awk)
  
  WGL / VEC test pattern is file used for (semiconductor) device testing and
  contains set of values forced at device input pins and expected output pin
  values.

Flow
  # run the retiming tool spedifying input and output files:

  [f@quad retime_testpattern]$ ./retime_pattern -f 0.9 -o o.vec i.wgl
  # retime_pattern is starting up...
  # launching the main engine... v0.3
  # factor range check...OK
  # input file type detection... WGL
  # exiting... {success}
  # done. 2012-07-01,12:20:57 (dur. 00:00:00)


  [f@quad retime_testpattern]$ ./retime_pattern
  # retime_pattern is starting up...
  retime_pattern usage:
  
    retime_pattern -f <factor_value> [-o <outfile>] [-h] <infile>
  
    -h|-help
          this help page
    <infile>
          this is required argument which specifies the WGL or VEC pattern
          file name to be retimed
          {be so nice and keep either .vec or .wgl file name suffix}
    -f|-factor <factor_value>
          the factor parameter is required parameter and <factor_value>
          describes how to retime pattern file:
          <factor_value> needs to be in the range: <1e-5,1e+5> where
          factor_value < 1.0 speeds up the pattern file timing.
    -o|-out <outfile>
          output file name specification parameter
          if not given then stdout is used instead
  
    retime_pattern was developed by freznicek (using Cygwin and RedHat Linux).
    retime_pattern requires [t]csh shell and gawk >= 3.1.0 processor.
